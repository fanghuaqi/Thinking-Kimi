Let Claude think comprehensively before responding!

## Overview

This project consists of two main components:
1. **Thinking Protocol**: A comprehensive set of instructions that guides Claude to think deeply and systematically before responding
2. **Browser Extension**: A tool that makes Claude's thinking process more readable and manageable in the browser interface

## Thinking Protocol

The thinking protocol instructs Claude to follow a natural, thorough thought process before providing responses.

## Browser Extension

The Chrome extension enhances the Claude interface by making the thinking process more manageable:

### Features

### Installation

## Usage

### Applying the Thinking Protocol

1. Copy the contents of `model_instructions.md`
